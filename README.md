# Credit-Analysis (Machine-Learning)
The following project aims to predict the eligibility of loan applicants for credit using several machine learning algorithms. The algorithms are assessed based on their accuracy score to select the best algorithm for building a predictive model

Algorithms Used a) Logistic Regression b) Decision Tree c) Random Forest d) Support Vector Machine e) Naive Bayes f) k - Nearest Neighbors g) Gradient Boosting Machine
